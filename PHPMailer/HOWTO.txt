A bit late, but perhaps someone will find it useful.

This problem can be caused by either 'less secure' applications trying to use the email account (this is according to google help, not sure how they judge what is secure and what is not) OR if you are trying to login several time in a row OR if you change countries (for example use VPN, move code to different server or actually try to login from different part of the world).

To resolve I had to: (first time)

    login to my account via web
    view recent attempts to use the account (you can access it via THIS link https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity?hl=en&pli=1)
    accept suspicious access.

This worked the first time, but few hours later, probably because I was doing a lot of testing the problem reappeared and was not fixable using the above method. In addition I had to clear the captcha (the funny picture, which asks you to rewrite a word or a sentence when logging into any account nowadays too many times) :

    after login to my account I went HERE: https://accounts.google.com/b/0/DisplayUnlockCaptcha
    Clicked continue

Hope this helps.
